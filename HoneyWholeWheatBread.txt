    "ingredients": [
        "1 cup lukewarm water",
"1 packet (2 1/2 teaspoons) yeast",
"1 teaspoon salt",
"1/4 cup honey",
"3 1/2 cups whole wheat flour",
"2 tablespoons vegetable oil",
"2 tablespoons butter (optional)"
                ],
    "instructions": [
          "In a large bowl, mix together the warm water, the yeast, the salt, and the honey, until the mixture is consistent throughout.",
"Add in 2 cups of flour and the vegetable oil, and beat until smooth.",
"Stir in the remaining flour until the dough begins to leave the sides of the bowl. Dough should be soft and easy to handle.",
"Let the dough sit 20-30 minutes, then transfer to lightly oiled surface and knead for about 8 minutes. Dough should be supple",
"Transfer the dough to a greased bowl, cover with a warm, damp cloth, and let sit 1-2 hours, until puffy (dough need not necessarily be doubled in size).",
"Return the dough to a lightly oiled surface and shape into a loaf; place the loaf in a loaf pan and cover with greased plastic wrap.", 
"Let rise until dough is an inch over the top of the pan in the center (about 1-2 hours). As the dough finishes rising, preheat the oven to 350°F.",
"Bake the bread for 30 minutes; do not overbake. If needed, tent the loaf with aluminum foil after the first 20 minutes, to prevent browning; whole wheat flour means this bread will tend to brown.",
"Remove from oven and let cool on a rack. If desired, rub the crust with butter to create a softer crust. Let bread cool completely before slicing."
